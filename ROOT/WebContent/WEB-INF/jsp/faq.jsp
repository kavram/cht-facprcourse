<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: Who needs First Aid, CPR, or
AED training?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is a branch of the
United States Department of Labor and has standards for first aid training in
general industry.  For example, section 29 CFR 1910.151(b), provides:  <i>&quot;In
the absence of an infirmary, clinic, or hospital in near proximity to the
workplace which is used for the treatment of all injured employees, a person or
persons shall be adequately trained to render first aid. Adequate first aid
supplies shall be readily available.”<br>
</i>Many employers want their employees trained in First Aid, CPR, and AED even
if it's not explicitly required for their industry. Some industry examples
include the following: construction workers/foremen, manufacturing, teachers
and coaches, childcare employees, fitness trainers, lifeguards, and boat
captains, Emergency Response Team (ERT) members, church/community groups,
healthcare workers, and professional rescuers.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: Is FirstAidCPRCourse.com’s curriculum
OSHA compliant?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A: Yes. The American Heart Association’s curriculum meets or exceeds OSHA
standards. Although AED training is not currently required, it is recommended
by OSHA.  FirstAidCPRCourse.com’s training also meets or exceeds ECC/ILORC
standards.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q. Am I obligated to do CPR if
I am certified? </span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A. Most professional rescuers have a duty to respond to an emergency where they
are work assigned.  Response by the same people would be considered a
&quot;Good Samaritan&quot; act when they are off-duty. If you are taking basic
First Aid, CPR, or AED training for self-improvement,<br>
you must decide whether or not to render assistance to a victim in need. Good
Samaritan laws protecting those who render aid to those in need vary from state
to state so it is good to educate yourself on the laws of your state on this
matter.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: Am I covered by the Good
Samaritan Law once I’m certified?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;
font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'><br>
A: This varies a bit by state.  California’s Good Samaritan law, for example,
states from Division 2.5 of the California Health and Safety Code:</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'>1799.102 <i>No person who in good faith, and not for compensation,
renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any
civil damages resulting from any act or omission.  The scene of an emergency
shall not include emergency departments and other places where medical care is
usually offered.</i></span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: What First Aid CPR Course training
is right for me?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A: This depends upon what requirements you are needing to fulfil.<br>
CPR Training typically covers care for adult, child, and infant cardiac arrest
and choking emergencies. First Aid Training teaches how to respond to medical
emergencies (e.g. heart attack, stroke and diabetic emergencies),
injury-related emergencies (e.g. bleeding and suspected fractures), and
environmental emergencies (e.g. hot and cold emergencies and allergic
reactions).<br>
CPR and AED training combines instruction in adult and child CPR and choking
care and the use of an Automated External Defibrillator (AED).</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: How long is my certification
good for?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A: Most certifications are valid for two years.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q: How do I recertify my
training?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A: FirstAidCPRCourse.com will either mail or email to you a reminder before
your certification expires.</span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:
"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";color:black'>Q. When do I get my certification
card?</span></strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
color:black'><br>
A. After the successful completion of your course, you will receive an
electronic copy of your certification certificate. The hard copies of your card
or certificate will be mailed to you within 7-10 business days thereafter. Some
businesses prefer to have all the certification cards mailed to the supervisor
who scheduled the training. If that is the case, cards will be sent out by mail
once payment or purchase order has been received. </span></p>

<p style='background:white'><strong><span style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:

style='font-size:9.5pt;font-family:"Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";
